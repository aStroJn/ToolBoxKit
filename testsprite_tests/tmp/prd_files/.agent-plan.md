# Agent Plan - ToolBoxKit Production Enhancement
**Generated**: 2024-12-29
**Objective**: Transform ToolBoxKit from basic React app to production-ready, globally scalable application with complete working converters

## Progress Summary
- ✅ **Audio Converter Upgrade**: Completed real FFmpeg integration with professional UI, batch processing, and format support (MP3, WAV, OGG, AAC, FLAC)
- ✅ **CDN Fixes Applied**: Resolved FFmpeg core file 404 errors with proper /dist/esm paths and enhanced fallbacks
- ✅ **Build System Verified**: Production build successful (92 modules, 3.95s build time)

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Testing
1. **Environment Setup & Tool Validation**
   - [ ] 1.1 Set up Python environment and test runner
   - [ ] 1.2 Initialize Testsprite for automated testing
   - [ ] 1.3 Generate test plans for all converter components
   - [ ] 1.4 Run comprehensive test suite
   
2. **Core Testing Foundation**
   - [ ] 2.1 Generate frontend test plans with login flow
   - [ ] 2.2 Generate backend test plans (if applicable)
   - [ ] 2.3 Execute test plans and validate results
   - [ ] 2.4 Address any test failures or edge cases

### Phase 2: Performance & Optimization
3. **Performance Validation**
   - [ ] 3.1 Benchmark FFmpeg conversion performance across file sizes
   - [ ] 3.2 Test memory usage patterns during batch conversions
