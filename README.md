## Project Overview

**ToolBoxKit** is a comprehensive web-based application that provides a collection of free, privacy-focused online tools. It's built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite. The application features a clean, modern interface with dark mode support, implemented with Tailwind CSS.

### Key Technologies

- **Framework**: React 19.1.1
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 with dark mode support
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7.8.2
- **State Management**: React Context API for theme management
- **Additional Libraries**: 
  - FileSaver for file operations
  - JSZip for zip compression
  - ESLint for code linting

### Project Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with:
- A main App component that sets up routing and theme context
- Context management for dark mode in `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx`
- Components in `src/components/` (e.g., Navbar)
- Pages in `src/pages/` directory (e.g., Home, Calculator, Converter)
- CSS styling using Tailwind CSS and custom CSS
- Configuration files for Vite, Tailwind, PostCSS, and ESLint

### Features

- **🌙 Dark Mode Toggle**: Persistent theme selection that saves to localStorage
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
- **🧮 Advanced Calculators**:
  - Simple Calculator with basic arithmetic
  - Scientific Calculator with trigonometric and logarithmic functions
  - Financial Calculator (Compound Interest, Simple Interest, Loan, EMI)
  - Interest Calculator for investment calculations
- **🔄 File Converters**:
  - Image Converter (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
  - Document Converter (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML)
  - Video Converter (MP4, WEBM, AVI)
  - Audio Converter (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- **📏 Unit Converters**:
  - Length, Mass, Time, Temperature, Current, Substance, Luminous
  - Time Arithmetic, Date Calculator, Time Expression
- **💻 Digital Tools**:
  - QR Code Generator with customizable settings
  - Password Generator with security strength indicator
  - Color Picker with palette generation
  - YouTube Downloader (simulation with educational notes)
- **🔒 Privacy First**: All processing happens locally in your browser
- **✅ No Registration**: Start using any tool immediately
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or a compatible package manager)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the application in development mode with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default (the port may vary).

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized static files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:

```

├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Navbar.jsx
│   ├── context/
│   │   └── ThemeContext.jsx
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Home.jsx
│   │   ├── Calculator.jsx
│   │   ├── SimpleCalculatorPage.jsx
│   │   ├── InterestCalculatorPage.jsx
│   │   ├── Converter.jsx

│   └── main.jsx
├── index.html
├── package.json

├── tailwind.config.js
└── postcss.config.js
```

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets that are not processed by the build tool.
- **`src/`**: The main source code directory.
  - **`assets/`**: Static assets like images and SVGs that are imported into components.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components used throughout the application.
    - **`converters/`**: Components related to file conversion.
    - **`digital-tools/`**: Components for digital tools like the YouTube downloader.
    - **`unit-converters/`**: Components for the various unit converters.
  - **`context/`**: React context providers, such as the `ThemeContext` for dark mode.
  - **`pages/`**: Top-level components that correspond to the different pages of the application.
  - **`App.jsx`**: The root component of the application, which sets up the routing.
  - **`main.jsx`**: The entry point of the application, where the root component is rendered.
- **`dist/`**: The output directory for the production build (generated by `npm run build`).
- **Configuration Files**:
  - **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration.
  - **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration.
  - **`postcss.config.js`**: PostCSS configuration.
  - **`eslint.config.js`**: ESLint configuration.

### Development Conventions

- **Component Naming**: PascalCase for React components
- **File Naming**: JSX for React components, CSS for styles
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for navigation between different tool sections
- **Styling**: Primarily Tailwind CSS utility classes with some custom CSS
- **Dark Mode**: Implemented using CSS classes and React context with localStorage persistence
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with recommended React hooks and refresh plugins

### Theme System

The application implements a dark/light mode toggle:
- State is managed in `ThemeContext.jsx`
- Uses CSS `dark:` classes from Tailwind
- Persists user preference in localStorage
- Respects system preference by default

### Navigation Structure

The application has a main navigation with:
- Home page as the landing page
- Calculator section with multiple calculator types
- Converter section for different conversion tools
- Digital tools section
- Each section contains multiple tool-specific pages
